# Time Series Forecasting Project

## Introduction

Time series forecasting is a crucial technique in predictive analytics, focusing on predicting future values based on historical data ordered in time. It finds extensive applications in various fields such as finance, economics, weather forecasting, and more. The significance of time series forecasting lies in its ability to uncover patterns, trends, and seasonalities within data, enabling informed decision-making and projections.

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a time series forecasting model using Python, focusing on predicting average temperatures. The provided code leverages popular libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Statsmodels to preprocess data, visualize trends, perform statistical tests, and build an ARMA (AutoRegressive Moving Average) model for forecasting.

## Code Description

1. **Data Preparation:** The code starts by importing necessary libraries and loading historical temperature data from a CSV file obtained from Kaggle. Data cleaning steps involve dropping missing values and unnecessary columns, converting the date column to a datetime format, and setting it as the index.

2. **Data Exploration:** After cleaning, the code explores the data by plotting the time series of average temperatures over time. This visualization helps in understanding the general trends and patterns present in the data.

3. **Stationarity Test:** The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test is performed to check the stationarity of the time series. A p-value below 5% indicates that the time series is stationary, which is a prerequisite for many time series forecasting models.

4. **Modeling:** An ARMA model is built using the Statsmodels library to forecast future temperature values. The model is trained on historical data, and predictions are made for a specific time period. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metric is used to evaluate the accuracy of the model's predictions.

5. **Parameter Optimization:** The code iterates through different combinations of ARMA model parameters to find the one with the lowest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), which is a measure of the model's goodness-of-fit.

6. **Model Evaluation:** Finally, the MAE metric is calculated again for the optimized ARMA model to assess its performance on the test data.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the process of building a time series forecasting model using the ARMA technique to predict future temperature values. By following the outlined steps and optimizing model parameters, accurate predictions can be made, enabling better decision-making in various applications.
